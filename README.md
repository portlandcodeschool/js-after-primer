What to do after taking the PCS primer and before taking a PCS Javascript class

### A Word on Learning Javascript
Don't be afraid. Expect frustration. These are the two best pieces of advice that PCS can give you regarding the journey using Javascript. Again: 
**Don't be afraid** and **Expect frustration**. You will learn to deal with these feelings, but it is still good to have healthy expectations of the journey, including the hard parts. Managing expectations will help you to remember and focus on the good parts: programming is fun, you are building cool things, you are stretching your brain in new ways, you are solving problems that you never solved before, and you are learning new ways to be creative. 

Remember that the computer will only do exactly what you tell it to do. Nothing is magic. The computer does not understand your intentions. Especially as you are starting out, you need to understand every line of code that you write. This means that going slow and going step by step. As painful as that might be, it provides you the best chance of long-term success. Try not to move onto the "next thing" until you have a decent grasp of the current problem you are trying to solve: give it at least a few more minutes.

Remember to come back and review basic concepts. You are a human and you will forget things. 

Studying Javascript well requires a graduate-school-level of commitment. You should start thinking of yourself as a Javascript scholar and begin to put in the study time that reflects that.

Learning by doing is even more important than being a scholar of Javascript (but you will still have to study ;-p ).Find projects that will help you learn. Find a project that must be completed and one that must actually work. This goal will help you solve problems like nothing else can. Keep using git and put these projects up on github. Practice making many commits and keeping your commits related to each feature.

Work in code at least 30 mins consecutively each day, at least six days a week (preferably more time each day). The more days you are away from code, the longer it takes to get back into it. You need at least 30 mins to get into one bit of code and effectively deal with it or learn about it. 

Go to meetups! See below.

Finally, Have fun!

### Sites

    + Workshoppers are sets of challenges involving JS and node.js in particular
    + Start with learnyounode
    + Don't search for help online to early. It's good to be frustrated, don't cheat (but don't wait too long either).

### More Git
- Advice: Start pushing your work up to github every time you work (assuming it is non-proprietary and can be shared with the public, such as a website for a client)
- More Advice: Learn new git commands when you encounter a problem. You probably won't be able to memorize all git commands.
